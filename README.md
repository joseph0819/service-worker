# Service Worker Project

This project implements a service worker to enhance the offline experience and optimize resource caching in a web application. The service worker intercepts network requests, allowing for efficient cache management and providing offline support.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser that supports service workers (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joseph0819/service-worker
```
1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```cd service-worker-project```
2. Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

## Features
Offline Support: The service worker caches essential resources, enabling the application to function offline by serving cached content.

Efficient Resource Caching: The service worker optimizes resource caching, enhancing performance by serving cached assets whenever possible.

## Usage
To integrate the service worker into your project, start by copying the provided sw.js file into your project's root directory. In your main HTML file, typically index.html, include the script for registering the service worker within the <head> element. This script, using the navigator API, checks for service worker support and registers the sw.js file. Customize the sw.js file to tailor the caching strategy and offline behavior according to your project's requirements. For quick testing, turn off the network or simulate offline conditions using browser developer tools, then reload your web application. You should observe that cached resources are served seamlessly when the network is unavailable.
